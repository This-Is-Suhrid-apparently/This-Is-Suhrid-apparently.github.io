## Work Experience
**Machine Learning Engineer @Eriez (_May 2024 - July 2024_)**
- Conducted data-collection, pre-processing, and modelling for developing novel domain-enriched classification model for identifying metal contaminants for industrial metal detection. 
- Developed Physically-informed learnable Denoisers for curating inputs from noisy time-series data.
- Worked under the supervision of [Dr. Ankit Tyagi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antyagi5/) and [Dr. Vishal Monga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishal-monga-a639153/)

**Graduate Research Assistant @PennState (_January 2024 - April 2024_)**
- Used LSTM and Attention-based architectures on temporal physical features for Multiple Classification-based tasks.
- Worked under the supervision of [Dr. Vishal Monga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishal-monga-a639153/)

**Graduate Research Assistant @PennState (_May 2023 - December 2023_)**
- Worked on the comparative study of Deep-Learning based surrogate models vs Differential Surrogate Models.
- Built Physics-based models that utilize NeuralODE to effectively model and solve dynamic systems.
- Worked under the supervision of [Dr. Daniel Kifer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielkifer/) and [Dr. Chaopeng Shen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chaopeng/)

**Graduate Teaching Assistant @PennState (_Jan 2023 - May 2023_)**
- Taught a course(EE 453) designed to introduce the fundamentals of digital signal processing. The emphasis was on analysis tools, the design of digital filters, and on the computation of the DFT.

**Graduate Teaching Assistant @PennState (_Aug 2022 - Dec 2022_)**
- Taught a course on the introduction to neural nets(EE 456) providing experiences in identifying the best types of NNs for a particular task, developing and applying them to solve difficult problems.

**Undergraduate Research Internship @IIT Guwahati (_Mar 2021 - Oct 2021_)**
- Worked on a project based on employing multiple antenna diversity to simulate OFDM and methods effective in reducing PAPR in the system. 

**Undergraduate Research Internship @BITS Pilani (_Apr 2021 - Sep 2021_)**
- Evolved an extensive study on the performance of a UWOC channel considering Generalised Gamma Fading by computing closed-form expressions for different statistical parameters under the integrated effects of oceanic turbulence and pointing errors and verifying the results through Monte-Carlo simulation.
- Authored a paper on this novel approach which is published at the 2022 IEEE 95th VTC.

**Undergraduate Industrial Training @Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Port Trust (_Sep 2020 - Oct 2020_)**
- Received technical and operational exposure to several industrial-grade instruments and systems used for the purposes of navigation, measurement, traffic control, and security in the Kolkata Port.
- Comprehended working principles behind Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler(ADCP), Differential Global Positioning System(DGPS), Vessel Traffic Management System(VTMS) and RFID-based Port Access Control System.
